# [1.1.0] - 2026-01-23

## Added

- CSS minifier enhanced with three levels:
  - `DEEP` (default): fully aggressive minification; removes comments, newlines, and all whitespace, then re-stringifies tokens.
  - `SMART`: removes comments and newlines; collapses consecutive whitespace into a single space; preserves single-space readability.
  - `SAFE`: removes comments and newlines only; preserves all original whitespace to avoid risky re-stringification.
- Leading and trailing newlines ignored in `SMART` mode to prevent extra spaces.
- Comprehensive test coverage added for all three levels, including:
  - Basic declarations, selectors, pseudo-classes, combinators.
  - Functions (`calc`, `linear-gradient`) and URL/string values.
  - Nested rules, media queries, and edge-case whitespace handling.

## Changed

- Default minification level changed from `SAFE` → `DEEP`.
- `minifyCSS` implementation refactored for clarity and maintainability.

## Fixed

- Prevent extra whitespace at start/end of minified CSS in `SMART` mode.
- Preserve spacing for single whitespace between values in `SMART` mode.
